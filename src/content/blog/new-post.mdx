## A heading 2

This is probably the **greatest** thing that's *ever* happened in my life. Now then, let's play. <s>A thin paint will stick to a thick paint.</s> La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown.<sup>TM</sup>

See there how easy that is. Poor old tree. You gotta think like a tree. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy.<sub>This is some subtext</sub>

### A heading 3

I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Use what you see, don't plan it. There are no limits in this world. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.

#### A heading 4

A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. All those little son of a guns. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.

#### Another heading 4

The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes.

The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You can do anything your heart can imagine. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.
